In this repository, I will document all the tools I learn throughout my cybersecurity journey, hoping it may also be useful for others.

## ‚úÖ Setup Components:
1. **VMware (or other virtualization platforms, e.g., VirtualBox)**
- *Description*: VMware or VirtualBox provides the virtualized environment needed for setting up and running different OS instances safely.

2. **Kali Linux Purple**
- *Description*: Kali Linux Purple is a specialized distribution tailored for cybersecurity professionals, offering pre-installed tools for both offensive and defensive security.

3. **Metasploitable 2**
- *Description*: Metasploitable 2 is a vulnerable virtual machine used for practice in penetration testing.

## Network Configuration

- Ensure that both **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable 2** are on the same virtual network. You can test the connectivity between the two machines using the `ping` command.

1. **Check IP Address on Kali Linux**:
   - Open a terminal on **Kali Linux** and run the following command to find the IP address assigned to your Kali machine:
     ```bash
     ifconfig
     ```
   - The `ifconfig` command displays the network configuration details for your network interfaces, including the IP address. Look for the section labeled `eth0` (or similar) and find the `inet addr` line, which shows your machine's IP address.

2. **Testing Connectivity**:
   - Once you have the IP address of your Metasploitable machine, you can test the connectivity between the two machines using the `ping` command:
     ```bash
     ping [IP address of Metasploitable]
     ```
   - Replace `[IP address of Metasploitable]` with the actual IP address assigned to your Metasploitable machine.
   - The `ping` command sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the specified IP address and waits for a reply. A successful ping response (e.g., `64 bytes from [IP address]: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.123 ms`) indicates that the machines can communicate with each other.

# ðŸ”“ Cracking a Linux Password on My Own Machine

I used **John the Ripper** to crack a Linux password on my own machine. The process involved several steps:

## Steps: 

1. **Create a New User:** 
    - I created a new user named `user2` with the password `user2` using the following commands:
      ```bash
      useradd -r user2  
      passwd user2
      ```

2. **Store the Password Hash:** 
    - I extracted the password hash and modified the file to retain only the hash for `user2`:
      ```bash
      sudo unshadow passwd shadow > /home/catalina/Desktop/linuxpass.txt
      ```

3. **Attempt to Crack the Password:** 
    - I used John the Ripper to check if the password could be found in the dictionary, but it was not successful:
      ```bash
      sudo john --format=crypt linuxpass.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst
      ```

4. **Change the Password:** 
    - I navigated to the password dictionary, changed user2â€™s password to "tamara," which I found in the dictionary, and then reapplied the previous steps. This time, the password was successfully cracked.
